## **2. GAME DESIGN PHILOSOPHY**


### **Why Card-Based Extraction?**


**Strategic Advantages:**
✅ **Proven Model** - Combines success of Hearthstone, Magic, Axie Infinity
✅ **Lower Development Cost** - No 3D world building required
✅ **Faster to Market** - Card games ship quicker than full metaverse
✅ **Mobile-Friendly** - Works on any device
✅ **Easy to Balance** - Patch cards without rebuilding worlds
✅ **Scalable** - Add new card sets infinitely
✅ **Clear Monetization** - Pack sales + marketplace fees
✅ **Competitive Ready** - Tournament structure built-in


**Extraction Element:**
- High-stakes risk/reward gameplay
- Permanent card loss creates scarcity
- Adrenaline-driven decision making
- Deflationary economy (cards become more valuable)


**Market Positioning:**
- **Not:** Another open-world metaverse (oversaturated)
- **Is:** Tactical card battler with extraction mechanics (unique)


---


## **3. BATTLE SYSTEM**


### **Core Wager Mechanic:**


**Pre-Battle:**
- Both players wager 3 cards each
- 6 cards total locked in smart contract
- Cards are visible to both players before battle starts


**Battle Resolution:**
- Tactical card-based combat (mechanics TBD in Question 3)
- Winner determined by strategy, deck composition, skill


**Post-Battle:**
- **Winner:** Selects 4 cards to keep, burns 2 cards permanently
- **Loser:** Loses all 3 wagered cards
- **Net Result:** Winner gains +1 card, 2 cards destroyed forever


### **Winner's Strategic Choices:**


**Collection Building (Primary Strategy):**
- Take 4 cards needed for crafting system
- Take cards that complete deck synergies
- Burn duplicate or unwanted cards
- Focus on long-term collection goals


**Alternative Strategies:**
- Value maximization (take most expensive cards)
- Meta disruption (burn powerful meta cards)
- Opponent weakening (take rival's best cards)


### **Economic Impact:**


**Per Match:**
- Winner: Net +1 card
- Loser: Net -3 cards
- Burned: 2 cards permanently removed


**Per 100 Matches:**
- 600 cards wagered total
- 400 cards kept by winners
- 200 cards burned (permanent deflation)
- Net circulation: -500 cards


**Annual Projection** (50 battles/day):
- Daily: 100 cards burned
- Monthly: 3,000 cards burned
- Yearly: 36,000 cards burned


*This creates massive scarcity and rising card values over time*

MINERSWARS TOKEN
# **MINERSWARS TOKEN - Creation Steps Overview**


---


## **How to Create $MINE Token:**


---


### **Step 1: Choose Blockchain**
- Decide which blockchain to deploy on
- Options: Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Solana, Arbitrum, Base, etc.
- Consider: Gas fees, speed, community, ecosystem


---


### **Step 2: Define Token Standards**
- ERC-20 (Ethereum/EVM chains)
- SPL (Solana)
- BEP-20 (Binance Smart Chain)
- Choose based on blockchain from Step 1


---


### **Step 3: Design Tokenomics**
- Total supply (fixed or unlimited?)
- Distribution breakdown (team, community, treasury, etc.)
- Vesting schedules
- Burn mechanisms
- Utility functions


---


### **Step 4: Write Smart Contract**
- Code the token contract
- Include: minting, burning, transfers, access control
- Add custom functions (staking, rewards, etc.)
- Use templates or hire developer


---


### **Step 5: Audit Smart Contract**
- Hire auditing firm (CertiK, Hacken, etc.)
- Fix vulnerabilities
- Get audit certificate
- Publish audit results


---


### **Step 6: Deploy Contract**
- Deploy to testnet first
- Test all functions
- Deploy to mainnet
- Verify contract on block explorer


---


### **Step 7: Create Liquidity Pool**
- Pair $MINE with stable token (USDC, ETH, etc.)
- Add initial liquidity on DEX (Uniswap, PancakeSwap, etc.)
- Lock liquidity (optional but recommended)


---


### **Step 8: List on Platforms**
- Submit to CoinGecko
- Submit to CoinMarketCap
- List on DEX aggregators
- Apply to CEX listings (later)


---


### **Step 9: Set Up Token Infrastructure**
- Create token website
- Set up block explorer links
- Create staking/rewards contracts
- Integrate with game


---


### **Step 10: Legal & Compliance**
- Consult crypto lawyer
- Ensure regulatory compliance
- Create terms of service
- Prepare legal disclaimers

## **🚨 REALITY CHECK: SOLO DEVELOPMENT**


---


## **CAN ONE PERSON DO THIS?**


**SHORT ANSWER:**


**YES... but with major caveats** ⚠️


You can build a **working prototype** alone.
You **cannot** launch a **polished, secure, successful game** alone.


---


## **WHAT ONE PERSON CAN REALISTICALLY DO:**


---

---


## **🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**


---


### **MUST DO:**


✅ **Security audit before mainnet** (non-negotiable)
✅ **Legal review before token launch** (non-negotiable)
✅ **Build community from day 1** (start early)
✅ **Test extensively on testnet** (avoid mainnet bugs)
✅ **Have emergency pause function** (safety net)
✅ **Document everything** (for team and users)
✅ **Collect user feedback constantly** (iterate quickly)
✅ **Monitor contracts 24/7 after launch** (catch issues fast)


---


### **NEVER DO:**


❌ **Launch on mainnet without audit** (recipe for disaster)
❌ **Ignore legal compliance** (risk of shutdown)
❌ **Build in isolation** (need community feedback)
❌ **Rush to launch** (quality over speed)
❌ **Overpromise features** (under-deliver kills trust)
❌ **Neglect security** (one hack = game over)
❌ **Ignore user feedback** (they're your customers)
❌ **Burn out** (pace yourself, it's a marathon)


---


## **💡 FINAL ADVICE**


---


### **REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:**

- $5k-20k monthly revenue
- Growing community (1,000+ Discord members)
- Positive user feedback
- No major security incidents
- Clear path to sustainability


**This is GOOD for a solo/small team launch!**


---


### **WHEN TO PIVOT:**


**Red Flags (Month 5-6):**
- Zero user traction despite marketing

- Technical challenges insurmountable


**Options:**

---


### **MENTAL HEALTH:**

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Join founder communities
- Find accountability partner
